    "- dynamic metadata refers to project information, such as its version, that is determined at build time rather than being hardcoded in the pyproject.toml file\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "- uv will only rebuild and reinstall local directory dependencies (e.g., editables) if the pyproject.toml, setup.py, or setup.cfg file in the directory root has changed, or if a src directory is added or removed\n",
    "- to incorporate additional information into the cache key for a given package, you can add cache key entries under ```tool.uv.cache-keys```, which covers both file paths and Git commit hashes. \n",
    "- Setting ```tool.uv.cache-keys``` will replace defaults, so any necessary files (like pyproject.toml) should still be included in the user-defined cache keys"
